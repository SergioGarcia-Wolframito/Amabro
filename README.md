## INTRODUCTION : 

It's based in some kind of online store quite simple, first, you have two options, login as User or Administrator.

## ADMINISTRATOR

If you choose the Administrator option, it will ask us to enter an UserName, Email and Password, which will be detailed in the "config" file, if the data arent equal, Amabro closes automatically.





- Once we have entered the data that is detailed in the "config", it will take us to the Admin menu.

Where we will have the option to manage : 

- Products :

- Categories:

Products and Categories are two independent lists, and you can add, delete and read the data of each list using the options in the admin menu.


## USER

If you choose the User option, it will ask you to enter a "UserName",an "Email" and "Password", and as a security measure, Amabro will ask you for the password again, and until both of them do not match, the user will not have access to it.
