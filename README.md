# Amabro
Amabro, is the name of my project.

## INTRODUCTION : 

It consists in a kind of online store quite simple, in which first, you have two options, enter as User or Administrator.

## ADMINISTRATOR

When you choose the Administrator option, it will ask us to enter an UserName, Email and Password, which will be detailed in the "config" file, if you do not enter the same data, Amabro closes automatically.





- Once we have entered the data that is detailed in the "config", it will take us to the Admin menu.

Where we will have the option to manage : 

- Products :

- Categories:

Products and Categories are two independent lists, and you can add, delete and read the data of each list using the options in the admin menu.


## USER

When you choose the User option, it will ask you to enter a UserName, Email and Password and as a security measure, Amabro will ask you for the password again, and until the two do not match, the user will not have access to it.

Once you are inside the user menu you can see that there are 5 useful options:

The other three options will be directly related to the store concept, since from them we can access the products, the categories and the fourth option where entering the number of a product, they can change their price in dollars to dollars.

This is a simple explanation of what Amabro does, it is a project that has a lot to improve and a lot to offer.
